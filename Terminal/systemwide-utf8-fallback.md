As noted in the [Terminal UTF8 Readme]() you can manually configure your system to use UTF-8 as the default locale.  Either of the following UI sequences should be sufficient.

* Control Panel > Clock and Region > Region > Administrative  > Change system locale  > Beta:Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support

* Settings > Time & Language > Language & region > Administrative language settings > Administrative > Change system locale > Beta:Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support
